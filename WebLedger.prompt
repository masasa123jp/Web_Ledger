This application is a web ledger application developed using the Agile Scrum methodology and is currently at the stage immediately after completing Sprint 4. The database employs SQLite, and it is planned t  -continue developing and refining the application over multiple sprints. In the next Sprint 5, we are considering the following feature additions and improvements:  A.Sprint 5 Backlogs. 1. User Experience Customization 1   -Allow users t  -freely personalize the layout and theme of the dashboard.   -Implement a feature enabling users with the admin and manager roles t  -add new ledgers.   -Migrate the ledger control and display item information (such as names, data types, maximum character lengths, and whether the item is subject t  -filter control), which are currently hard-coded in Python, JavaScript, and HTML, t  -be managed centrally in the database.   -Develop a new (Ledger Master Management Screen) dedicated t  -registering and editing the above ledger information, and make it accessible via a link in the application header.  2. User Experience Customization 2   -Continue t  -allow users t  -personalize the layout and theme of the dashboard.   -Enable users with the admin and manager roles t  -add or delete existing ledger items.   -T  -achieve this, review and revise the structure of the ledger table in the database and create a new (Ledger Item Master Table) that manages the items used for each ledger as detailed rows.   -Instead of managing an entire ledger in a single row, refactor the system s  -that each items information (name, data type, maximum character length, filter control target, etc.) is managed in separate rows.  3. User Experience Customization 3   -Allow users t  -set the columns displayed in each ledger via on-screen operations.   -Accordingly, create a new (User-Specific Ledger Display Settings Table) that can store and utilize the column information configured by each user.   -Enable users t  -download reports based on the display settings of their configured ledgers (the reports will be generated from the aforementioned User-Specific Ledger Display Settings Table).  4. Enhancement of Ledger Data Edit History Functionality and Modal   -Enhance the functionality t  -more precisely manage the update history of ledger data.   -Specifically, accumulate information such as the updating user, update timestamp (t  -the second), the name of the ledger being updated, the row number, the column name, and the values before and after the change.   -In parallel, expand the content and operability of the modal window displayed during ledger updates s  -that users can more clearly verify the update details.  5. Enhanced Multilingual Support (Japanese/English)   -Implement support for switching between Japanese and English in the ledger type selection list box.   -Enable language switching for ledger item names and other displayed texts.   -Additionally, introduce a mechanism for Japanese/English support for various on-screen texts (such as labels and button names), allowing users t  -easily switch languages.  6. Advanced Report Dashboard   -Develop a comprehensive analytics dashboard that includes customizable reporting functions and export options.   -Display various analytical results in an easily understandable visual format t  -support business decision-making.  7. External Integration (Integration with Generative AI)   -Integrate with generative AI services (such as OpenAI) t  -incorporate AI-driven analytical features int  -the application.   -Enable the application t  -present advanced suggestions and analytical results based on the ledger content t  -users.  8. Enhanced AI Analysis   -Improve the anomaly detection algorithms t  -extract anomalies more accurately.   -Provide detailed visualizations of the identified anomalies, along with reports that enable users t  -quickly investigate and address the causes.  9. Enhanced Machine Learning   -Introduce predictive analysis models t  -add functionality that can forecast future trends and risks based on ledger data.   -Reflect the prediction results on the dashboard in real time or on a regular basis t  -aid business decision-making.  10. Performance Optimization   -Optimize SQL queries and reduce server response times t  -handle large-scale data.   -Consider implementing indexing or caching mechanisms as necessary t  -enhance scalability.  B.Other Requests.   -Please document several feature improvements and new functionalities t  -be tackled from Sprint 6 onward as multiple backlog items.   -For example, consider further enhancements t  -UI/UX, additional external service integrations, and security reinforcement measures.  C.Conclusion.   -The above outlines the specific feature expansions and improvements being considered for Sprint 5, as well as the requests for future (Sprint 6 and beyond) development. Based on these items, please continue advancing the Scrum development process t  -enhance the overall functionality and user experience of the application.
